# Archive Index

Append-only log of headlines sent in past briefs. The daily routine writes to
this file at the end of Stage 4 (Publish & Archive), and reads from it at the
start of Stage 0 (Load history) to build the dedup EXCLUDE set covering the
last 2-3 days.

## Format

One item per line, tab-separated, four fields:

```
date<TAB>headline<TAB>short-hash<TAB>key-entities
```

- `date` — ISO date the item was sent, e.g. `2026-06-05`.
- `headline` — the headline as it appeared in the brief.
- `short-hash` — an 8-character hash derived from the canonical story (used
  for fast exact-match dedup).
- `key-entities` — comma-separated named entities (people, orgs, places,
  tickers) used for fuzzy dedup. See `dedup.md` for the matching rules.

## Example format

```
2026-06-03	Fed holds rates steady, signals one cut by year-end	a1b2c3d4	Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, FOMC, USD
2026-06-03	Singapore GDP revised up to 3.4% on services strength	e5f6a7b8	MAS, MTI, Singapore, SGD
2026-06-04	OpenAI announces new enterprise tier with on-prem option	9c0d1e2f	OpenAI, Sam Altman, Microsoft, enterprise AI
```

The rows above are illustrative only. The real log begins below this line and
is empty until the first run.
